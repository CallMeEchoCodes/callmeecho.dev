Hello, world! I've been working on this website on and off for a while now, and I'm finally ready to start posting!

This post is mainly a test of the blog system but I'll try to keep it somewhat interesting.

## Animations

I use a Tailwind plugin called [TAOS](https://versoly.com/taos) to make my animations. It can be a bit of a pain to get working but if you've seen the main page of this site, you already know it's worth it.

Once it's set up, animations can be added to any element using Tailwind modifiers (think `hover:bg-blue-500` but for animations). Here's how I use it on the main page:

```html title="src/pages/index.astro"
<h1
	class="taos:opacity-0 taos:translate-y-[-100%] transition-animation my-5 text-center font-display text-6xl font-bold duration-700">
	Heya! I'm Echo.
</h1>
<p
	class="taos:opacity-0 taos:translate-y-[100%] transition-animation pb-5 text-center text-lg delay-[900ms] duration-700">
	I'm a developer who makes random and usually useless things for the internet.
</p>
```

Let's break down the TAOS classes:

-   The `taos:` prefix tells the plugin to apply a class while the animation hasn't been triggered.
-   `delay-[900ms]` tells the animation to wait 900ms after being scrolled into view before starting.
-   `duration-700` tells the animation to last 700ms.

With that tiny bit of code, you can make your site look a lot more interesting. Just look at the main page!
